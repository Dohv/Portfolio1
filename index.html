        <div class='about'><p class='info'>I bring joy and passion to the web development field. I work as a part of the team, never leaving a man behind.  I am a listener who is always looking to learn.  I believe that people, when in the correct environment, are capable of achieving anything.  My ambitions match well with hard work and consistency, giving me the ability to overcome any obstacle with focus and love for what I do.</p>
        <p class='info'>After my military service in the Israeli Defense Forces, I completed my Bachelors degree in Psychology at Touro College. My interest in how people think led me to App Academy's online course in JavaScript and later to General Assembly's Web Develoment Immersive coding bootcamp in New York, where I learned to build and design full stack web applications. I am always looking to learn more and to grow as a person and as a programmer. </p>
        <p class='info'>Hope you enjoy my site!</p>
